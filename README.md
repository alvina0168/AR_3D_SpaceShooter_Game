# AR_3D_SpaceShooter_Game
AR Sketch Invaders is a mobile-based Augmented Reality (AR) space shooter game developed using Unity and Vuforia. The game allows players to scan a real-world rocket sketch or image target and bring it into a 3D AR space battle environment. Players control their spaceship using gyroscope-based movement and defeat waves of alien enemies by tapping the screen to shoot. The project explores how AR can enhance creativity, engagement, and interactivity by combining user-generated content with real-time gameplay.
